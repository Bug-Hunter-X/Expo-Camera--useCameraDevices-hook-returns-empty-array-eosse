# Expo Camera useCameraDevices Hook Returns Empty Array

This repository demonstrates a bug where Expo's `useCameraDevices` hook consistently returns an empty array, preventing access to the device camera even with permissions granted.  The solution provided addresses this issue.

## Problem

The `useCameraDevices` hook, intended to retrieve available camera devices, unexpectedly returns an empty array. This occurs despite having explicitly requested and received camera permissions. The app remains unable to initialize the camera.

## Solution

The issue is resolved by ensuring that the asynchronous operations related to permissions and camera initialization are handled correctly, preventing race conditions and ensuring all necessary setup occurs before attempting camera access.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
